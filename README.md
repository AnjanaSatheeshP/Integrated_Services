## 🚀 Project Overview

This webpage was made to fulfill the needs of customers with Household problems. In this website, workers are allotted on the basis of daily wages, and it may contain workers like plumbers, carpenters, gardeners, cleaners, etc. There are basically three modules in my website: admin, Customer, and employee. Here, the Admin has the overall control over allotting the work requested by the customer to the respective employees.

Used Python Django because it helps us build web applications quickly and efficiently. It offers many built-in features, like authentication and an admin interface, which simplify development.
